                    I'm sure you have heard of Gamestops crazy price and effect on the stock market. But where and how did this start?
                </p>

                <p> It all started on a site called Reddit. On reddit we have a section(known as subreddit) that we call Wall Street Bets. Here users discuss stocks and how to invest. As always no one is a professional, do your own research and invest wisely</p>

                <p> at this site we we will help you learn about the stocks that Reddit is talking about. Invest wisely on your own.</p>
